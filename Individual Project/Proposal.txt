Title: Dumb Mixer (Not Final)
Things Used:
1. Music Library
2. Accelerometer
3. Touchscreen

The application is going to use the User's Music Library along with the touch screen and the accelerometer. So the user will be able to add a song to the app. It does not have to be only one song, but also multiple ones (it is more fun it is multiple songs at once). The user will then be able to shake his phone, and based on the motion used, the mix of songs will change effects either by changing the sonud, speeding it up, slowing it down, changing the pitch of the vocal, playing it backwards, and even like mix the multiple songs into one. 
Other than the acclerometer, a touchscreen will also be included. To make things fun, there will be like only one big button, that doesn't say what it does, and that button will randomly affect the song in any way. This is the basic idea of my projcet. I hope you think it is plausible to do and fun.
