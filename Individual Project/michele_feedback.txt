I like the clean-ness of the design. I open the app and I know exactly what I need to do. It’s slightly unclear that the large picture is a button, but that’s part of the exploration that comes with opening a new app. What would be kind of cool is if you kept repeating the word that I typed every few seconds. 

Good job finishing the app - if you want to keep modifying it to make an app you are really proud of, you are welcome to do that.
