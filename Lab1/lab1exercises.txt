A. I typed python manage.py runserver. I went to the url of my server/movies.

B. The URL is the server/movies/(numberofmovie). The URL would always be the number of that movie in the list.

C.This function gets called:
 def add_movie(request):
    newmovie = Movie(title=request.POST['movie_title'])
    # when making new objects, always remember to save them
    newmovie.save()
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/movies')
